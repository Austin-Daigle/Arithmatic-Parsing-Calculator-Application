# Arithmetic Parsing Calculator Application
This is a java program that uses recursive descent parsing to evaluate arithmetic statements within a GUI calculator application

# Supported Mathematical Functions:
  * Multiplication
  * Addition
  * Division
  * Subtraction
  * Sine
  * Cosine
  * Tangent
  (Support for Radians and Degrees)
  
# How to use
Download the [source code](https://github.com/Austin-Daigle/Arithmatic-Parsing-Calculator-Application/blob/main/Calculator.java) and compile and execute it via the command line or download the [executable jar file](https://github.com/Austin-Daigle/Arithmatic-Parsing-Calculator-Application/blob/main/Calculator.jar) and double click it to start; a UI will appear and you can either you the UI button or keystokes to operate the function.

# Inportant usage notes:
When using trig function be sure to only put in decimal points and alway make sure to close thoses statement with a closing parentheses.

also make sure to alway follow the order or operations and check if the calculator is set to degrees or radians when calculating a trig function.
